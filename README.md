**#Financial Data ETL Pipeline**
A scalable pipeline to collect, clean, and analyze equity/financial data

**Project Overview**

This ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline automates the collection and standardization of financial data from structured and unstructured sources, including:

Market data (e.g., stock prices, indices)
Unstructured news (New York Times API)
Fundamental data (e.g., company filings)
Built with Python, Docker, and MySQL, it serves as a foundation for equity research, index management, and quantitative analysis.

**#Key Features**

Automated Data Collection
Fetches data from APIs (NYTimes) and web sources
Handles both structured (tables) and unstructured (news) data

Data Quality & Standardization
Cleans missing values, outliers, and formatting inconsistencies
Standardizes fields for downstream analysis (e.g., tickers, timestamps)

Modular & Scalable
Containerized with Docker for easy deployment
Configurable parameters for different data sources and use cases

SQL Integration
Stores processed data in MySQL for querying and reporting
Supports integration with PowerBI/Tableau

Technical Stack

Component	            Technology Used
Extraction            Python (requests, BeautifulSoup), NYTimes API
Transformation	      Python (pandas, numpy), regex
Loading	              MySQL, Docker
Orchestration	        Bash scripting


How It Works

Extract: Pulls data from APIs/web sources.
Transform:
Cleans text (news articles) and numerical data (stock prices)
Standardizes formats (e.g., dates, currency)
Load: Writes structured output to MySQL for analysis.

Business Applications

Equity Index Management: Track constituents, free float, and sector classifications.
Quantitative Research: Backtest trading strategies using cleaned data.
Risk Analysis: Correlate news sentiment with market movements.
Setup (For Users)

**Future Enhancements Roadmap**

1. Institutional-Grade Data Integrations

Expand API support for premium financial data providers (e.g., Bloomberg, S&P Global, FactSet)
Implement adaptive scraping for regulatory filings (SEC, ESMA, etc.)
2. Intelligent Data Validation

Real-time anomaly detection for outliers in pricing/volume data
NLP-powered sentiment analysis on news/filings to flag material events
3. Cloud-Native Deployment

Modularize pipeline for serverless execution (AWS Lambda/Azure Functions)
Add Airflow/Prefect orchestration for scheduled runs and dependencies
4. Advanced Analytics Ready

Generate derived metrics (e.g., index constituent correlations, liquidity scores)
Output support for columnar formats (Parquet) optimized for analytics tools
5. Enterprise Scalability

Role-based access controls for sensitive financial data
Audit logging for compliance with financial data governance standards
